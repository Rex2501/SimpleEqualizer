before 2024/1/2
    developing ideas & structure
    It can do
        1. make noise with a given gain
        2. make noise and record it at the same time


2024/1/2 - 2024/1/9
    1. finish the tuning functions
        i. Doing fft for the recorded data
        ii. find the sensitive between gain variable in python and real speaker system
        iii by the sensitive we found, determine the bandwith of the speaker system
        iv. tune the frequency by the given frequency and the bandwith
    2. check if it can work
        i. Doing fft for the final result
        ii. check if the spectrum is what we want

to-arrange
1. ui
    i. pyqt6
    ii. new class for ui to help update the information on it

2024/1/20 finish the first version of the project
2024/1/30 rearrange the code and make it more readable and the whole project include the paper


-----------------2024/1/3-----------------
1. do the fft for the recorded data

-----------------2024/1/4-----------------
1. new function to find overall gain
2. new function can find the corresponding gain for each frequency

-----------------2024/1/15-----------------
1. design how to tune the gain defination between eq and code

-----------------2024/1/16 -> 1/19-----------------
1. fix dumb fft problem
2. Source wac sampling rate and depth from 384kHz to 768kHz and 16bit to 64bit
