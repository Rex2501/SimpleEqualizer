# SimpleEqualizer
It can help you tune your stereo system easily.
Inspire the capacity of the speaker.
# Why am I doing this?
After Windows updates, my EQ setting is always deleted. It isn't enjoyable to tune Eq again. So, I use "SimpleEqualizer" to help do the processes faster.
# Is it accurate?
It depends on how accurate your hardware is. For me, I only have a 30 USD microphone. There is no high-end equipment helping me make the system better.
